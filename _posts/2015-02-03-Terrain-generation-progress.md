New contributor Daniel "creatorfromhell" Vidmar has been working on a better
terrain generator. He's built several unique biomes and support for decorators
like the dungeon pictured above. On top of that, this terrain generator is
deterministic, so the same seed produces the same world every time.

Yesterday, I also added rudimentary world persistence to the server and wrote up
a contributor agreement so that have a written statement from all contributors
verifying that they have not read decompiled Minecraft source.

Exciting development continues!
