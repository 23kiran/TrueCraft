Wheat farming was implemented yesterday, making it possible for players to grow their own wheat farm.
Farmland saturation was also implemented, making TrueCraft better every day that goes by.

Sugar cane farming was implemented too, leaving new possibilites for players to survive in the TrueCraft world.

With these updates, a TrueCraft player can survive for a long time in the TrueCraft world.
