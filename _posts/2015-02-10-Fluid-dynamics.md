With today's arduous coding efforts, fluid dynamics are mostly working and quite
close to vanilla's implementation. Fluids in Minecraft is a form of celluar
automaton that has a set of rules for how it propagates through the game world,
and it's a huge pain in the ass to get right.

There are still some problems with the implementation that will need to be
sorted out, but most of it is working correctly. This is currently only
supported for water, but it should be easily extended to support Lava when the
time comes.

Additionally, I streamed the entire development of this feature on Twitch.tv, to
a rather large number of viewers. Hi everyone! I'll continue to stream some of
my work on TrueCraft going forward, and I hope to see some folks hanging out in
[twitch.tv/sircmpwn](http://www.twitch.tv/sircmpwn).
