With the help of some 3D noise, caves are now being generated for TrueCraft
worlds. Additionally, support for tile entities has been added, and the new
support for signs demonstrates that. Now that tile entities are working, work on
things like chests and furnaces can begin.

Also, new contributor ToastyMallows was kind enough to implement the behavior of
trap doors and sent that along in a pull request. I also fixed a bug with torch
placement and block support, but that's boring so I won't mention it.
